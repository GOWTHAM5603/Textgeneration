Down the Rabbit-HoleAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on thebank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into thebook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations init, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures orconversations?'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for thehot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasureof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up andpicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ranclose by her.There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it soVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, itoccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the timeit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCHOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she hadnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watchto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the fieldafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a largerabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering howin the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and thendipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deepwell.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wasgoing to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out whatshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then shelooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled withcupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictureshung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves asshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her greatdisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fearof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards asshe fell past it.'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shallthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me athome! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the topof the house!' (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder howmany miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be gettingsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be fourthousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt severalthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though thiswas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as therewas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitudeor Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, orLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH theearth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk withtheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather gladthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all theright word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the countryis, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (andshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're fallingthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what anignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do toask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon begantalking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk attea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are nomice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's verylike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alicebegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamysort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Dobats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozingoff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand withDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was anotherlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, andwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my earsand whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when sheturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hangingfrom the roof.There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and whenAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying everydoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever toget out again.Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solidglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice'sfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the secondtime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried thelittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, notmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passageinto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out ofthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers andthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through thedoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'itwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I couldshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were reallyimpossible.
